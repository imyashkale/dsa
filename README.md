# Data Structures and Algorithms

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of Data Structures and Algorithms implemented in Golang. Each DSA is organized into its own package with corresponding test cases.

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**
   - Go installed on your machine.
   - Basic understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms.

2. **Installation**
   - Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/imyashkale/dsa.git`
   - Navigate to the project directory: `cd dsa`

3. **Running Tests**
   - Run `go test ./...` in the root directory to execute all test cases.

## Structure

- Each data structure and algorithm is encapsulated in its own package.
- Test cases are provided within each package for validation.

## Continuous Integration

- GitHub Actions are set up to automatically run tests on each push, ensuring code integrity and functionality.
